Instructions

Have at least 2 data entities (data resources) in addition to the User Model - one entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

☐ Use OAuth authentication.

☐ Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work (typically CRD data operations) by "protecting" those routes from anonymous users using the ensureLoggedIn middleware from the OAuth lesson. In addition, ensure that editing and deletion of a data resource can only be done by the user that created that data (this is done in the controller - refer to the Guide to User-Centric CRD).

☐ Have CRD data operations somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that Creates a post and satisfy Delete functionality by implementing the ability to delete comments. - That's CREATE, READ, and DELETE.
